# Welcome, Developer!

Thank you for your interest in joining our team as a **Frontend Developer** with a focus on **Advanced Infrastructure**. This take-home test is designed to evaluate your technical expertise, coding standards, and your ability to write clean, maintainable code that aligns with production-level practices.

We are excited to see how you approach problems, design solutions, and showcase your skills. Here's everything you need to know to get started:

## What We're Testing

This take-home test will assess your:

1. **Code Quality**: Writing clean, readable, and maintainable code.
2. **Best Practices**: Adherence to industry standards and production-grade development practices.
3. **Problem-Solving**: Your ability to think critically and approach challenges methodically.
4. **Frontend Proficiency**: Mastery of modern frontend frameworks, tooling, and workflows.
5. **Attention to Detail**: Your ability to follow instructions and meet outlined requirements.

## Instructions

1. **Create a repo**:
   You're welcome to create your own repository and share it with us.
   We've created a boiler plate repo you can clone - either option is alright


2. **Project Requirements**:
   - The requirements for the task are outlined in the `README.md` file in the repository.
   - Make sure to follow the provided guidelines closely.

3. **Technology Stack**:
   - Use **React** (or your preferred frontend framework if explicitly allowed).
   - Follow best practices for **state management**, **component structuring**, and **styling**.
   - Use tools like **ESLint**, **Prettier**, or **Husky** to enforce code quality.

4. **Submission**:
   - Create a public or private repository with your completed project.
   - Share the repository link with us, ensuring we have the necessary permissions to review it.

## Evaluation Criteria

Your submission will be evaluated based on the following:

1. **Code Organization**: Is your project structure intuitive and scalable?
2. **Styling**: Are your UI designs polished and responsive?
3. **Performance**: Have you considered performance optimizations?
4. **Documentation**: Is your code well-commented and accompanied by a README?
5. **Testing**: Have you included unit or integration tests? (e.g., using Jest, React Testing Library, etc.)

## Bonus Points

- Usage of **TypeScript**.
- Implementing modern UI libraries (e.g., Tailwind, Material-UI).
- CI/CD workflows (e.g., GitHub Actions).
- Accessibility best practices (ARIA, semantic HTML).

## Timeline

You will have **7 days** from the time of receiving this document to complete the test. Please reach out if you have any questions or encounter any issues.

## Final Thoughts

We value your time and effort, and we look forward to seeing how you tackle this challenge. Remember, this test is an opportunity for you to demonstrate your skills and creativity, so have fun with it!

Best of luck!
